# CI Optimization Summary

## Problem Identified
The CI tests were taking **4 minutes 50 seconds** with the main bottleneck being the `Build liboqs` step taking **3 minutes 5 seconds**. This was caused by building the entire liboqs library with all algorithms instead of just the ones needed for the project.

## Root Cause
The `scripts/build_liboqs.sh` script was building the complete liboqs library including:
- All KEM algorithms (Classic McEliece, Kyber, HQC, BIKE, Frodo, Saber, NTRU, SIKE)
- All signature algorithms (Falcon, SPHINCS+, Rainbow, Picnic, qTESLA, GeMMS, LedaCrypt, Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Optimized Build Script (`scripts/build_liboqs.sh`)
Modified the CMake configuration to only build the specific algorithms needed:
- **ML-KEM-768** (Kyber Level 3) - recommended KEM algorithm
- **ML-DSA-65** (Dilithium Level 3) - recommended DSA algorithm

**CMake flags added:**
```bash
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_KYBER=ON
-DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_DILITHIUM=ON
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_KYBER_768=ON
-DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_DILITHIUM_3=ON
```

**CMake flags disabled:**
```bash
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_KYBER_512=OFF
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_KYBER_1024=OFF
-DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_DILITHIUM_2=OFF
-DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_DILITHIUM_5=OFF
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_CLASSIC_MCELIECE=OFF
-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_HQC=OFF
# ... and many more algorithms disabled
```

### 2. Enhanced CI Caching (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Updated cache keys to include `liboqs-optimized-` prefix for better cache identification
- Added fallback to previous cache keys for backward compatibility
- Added documentation comments explaining the optimization

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization
- **Total CI time**: ~4m 50s
- **liboqs build time**: ~3m 5s
- **Builds**: All algorithms (50+ algorithms)

### After Optimization
- **Expected total CI time**: ~2m 30s (50% reduction)
- **Expected liboqs build time**: ~1m 30s (50% reduction)
- **Builds**: Only 2 required algorithms

### Cache Benefits
- **First run**: Faster build due to reduced algorithm count
- **Subsequent runs**: Near-instant build due to cache hits
- **Cache invalidation**: Only when build script changes

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Mapping
- **ML-KEM-768** → `OQS_ENABLE_KEM_KYBER_768=ON`
- **ML-DSA-65** → `OQS_ENABLE_SIG_DILITHIUM_3=ON`

### CMake Configuration
The optimized build uses the same CMake flags as before but selectively enables only the required algorithms, maintaining compatibility while reducing build time.

### Cache Strategy
- **Primary key**: `liboqs-optimized-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('scripts/build_liboqs.sh') }}`
- **Fallback keys**: Previous cache versions for smooth transitions
- **Cache paths**: `/usr/local/lib/liboqs*`, `/usr/local/include/oqs`, `/usr/local/lib64/liboqs*`

## Verification
To verify the optimization is working:
1. Check CI logs for reduced build time
2. Verify only required algorithms are compiled
3. Ensure all tests still pass
4. Monitor cache hit rates in subsequent runs

## Future Improvements
1. **Parallel builds**: Consider using `ninja` instead of `make` for faster builds
2. **Pre-built binaries**: Explore using pre-compiled liboqs packages
3. **Dependency caching**: Cache system dependencies (build-essential, cmake, etc.)
4. **Matrix optimization**: Consider running tests in parallel across different Python versions
